The Loop GUI depends on both a python environment as well as some C++ libraries.

For the python environment install both map2loop, LoopStructural, LoopProjectFile and pybind11 which is most easily accessible via anaconda:

	conda install -c loop3d -c conda-forge map2loop loopStructural loopprojectfile pybind11

For the C++ environment install Qt5, loopprojectfile-cpp and netCDF-cxx4:

	https://www.qt.io/download

	https://github.com/Loop3D/LoopProjectFile-cpp

	https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/
	or vcpkg install netcdf-cxx4 (windows)


Download and compile loop3d code using the loop3d.pro project file.

Note a LPGL version binary of the GUI for Windows 10 will soon be available (check again soon).
